YACoin Official Development Testing Tree.
---------------------------------------

The testing distribution contains code and features that haven't yet been accepted into the stable release and is used for testing. This release should not be used for production as things will most likely break. 

You should normally run YACoin testing in testnet and absolutely DO NOT use your main wallet in YACoin testing!

Development process
===========================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready. For new features or
enhancements to YACoin, please submit pull requests to YACoin testing. 
Please refer to: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
if you need any help.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
